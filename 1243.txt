Respected sir
Good evening sir.
Sir
I have been transferred to the position of Tahsildar, Annur. The office is 30 km away from my home sir and I am unable travel such long distances every day due to severe back pain sir. 
Sir currently my health is not that well, affected by High BP and Piles and I have already given relinquishment for the post of Taluk Regular Tahsildar considering my health condition.
I met the Collector on 15.07.2024 and explained my health condition. Collector sir assured to consider my request. 
But suddenly today hey are pressurizing me to join anyways. I again met Collector sir again on 19.07.2024, Collector instructed me to join immediately disregarding my pervious requests. 
Sir,
I humbly submit that due to my present health condition, I am not in a position to join as Taluk Tahsildar. 
Sir I kindly request your help with this issue sir.
